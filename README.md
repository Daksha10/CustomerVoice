# üìù Customer Feedback Analysis System

An AI-powered system that processes customer feedback to extract emotions, identify topics, and compute an overall sentiment score (**Adorescore**). This helps businesses gain insights into customer sentiment and take data-driven actions to improve their services.

## üöÄ Features
- **Emotion Detection**: Uses a BERT-based transformer to classify emotions.
- **Topic Analysis**: Extracts main topics & subtopics using SpaCy NLP.
- **Adorescore Calculation**: Computes a sentiment score (-100 to +100) based on emotions & topic relevance.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with **Streamlit** for real-time feedback analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Radar charts & detailed breakdowns for sentiment insights.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
The system consists of three core modules:
1. **Emotion Detection (`emotion.py`)** - Identifies emotions & activation levels.
2. **Topic Analysis (`topic.py`)** - Extracts topics & assigns relevance scores.
3. **Adorescore Calculation (`adorescore.py`)** - Computes sentiment scores.

## üîß Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Machine Learning Model**: BERT-based Transformer (for emotion classification)
- **NLP**: SpaCy (for topic extraction)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Plotly (for radar charts & sentiment analysis)
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud / Local Server
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
